i could quickly see the differences and where the typo was


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

you can see how to make similar changes in the future

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I can control exactly what is committed and the state it is in

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because multiple files might be considered one unit of work

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
you can compare two versions using diff after you find them using log

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always go back to an older version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
exciting new work
